# Using Containers for Deployment
A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings

## Technologies Used
- [Docker](docker.com) - Docker is a computer program that performs operating-system-level virtualization
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) - Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications
